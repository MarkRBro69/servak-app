# **Social Server**  

**Social Server** is a backend platform designed for a social media-like application.  
It enables users to create posts, follow others, comment on posts, and communicate in real-time chats.  

## üìã Features  

- **User Management**  
  - Register, log in, and manage user profiles.  
  - Follow or unfollow other users to create a personalized feed.  

- **Post Management**  
  - Create, edit, and delete posts.  
  - Comment on posts and interact with other users.  

- **Real-Time Chat**  
  - Send and receive messages in real-time via WebSockets.  
  - Participate in group or private chats.  

## üõ† Technology Stack  

1. **Frontend Proxy:** Nginx  
2. **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker & Kubernetes  
3. **Programming Language:** Python  
4. **Web Framework:** Django & Django Rest Framework (DRF)  
5. **Messaging Queue:** Kafka  
6. **Databases:**  
   - Relational: PostgreSQL  
   - Non-relational: MongoDB  
7. **Caching:** Redis  
8. **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets  
9. **File Storage:** NFS (Network File System)  

## üèó Microservices Architecture  

The system follows a **microservices architecture** to ensure separation of concerns and scalability. The key microservices are:

1. **Users Service**  
   - Manages user authentication, profiles, and follower relationships.  

2. **Posts Service**  
   - Handles the creation, editing, and deletion of posts.  
   - Manages comments and interactions on posts.  

3. **Chats Service**  
   - Manages real-time chat functionality, including private and group chats.  

Each service communicates using **Kafka** for event-driven architecture and real-time updates.
